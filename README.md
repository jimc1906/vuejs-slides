# Updating IBC Slides

The front web page for K-Station Music (https://sites.google.com/view/ibc-music) is a Google Site. That site is owned by a common Google account. The account is `ibckidsmusic` and the password is `strumthechords`.

Log into https://sites.google.com and click on the Site project:

Clicking on one of the images (for Oldtown/Downtown) should reveal a button with a link:
